CES
===

C++ Embedded Script - CES is used to write template file for code generation. 

# Problem 
Code generation tools are often needed in large projects, but writing such tools is not complex but mainting them 
as the generation needs evolve is usually tedious. 

The solution of embedding script code into _source_ code simplifies both reading and maintainability of template files.
CES is a simple library that parse template file with embedded Lua code generate files.

# Features

* Source-Language independant (CES doesn't parse the _source_ language, it can be whatever you want) 
* Expose your C++ to Lua (You can access to your datas/methods from embedded-Lua script)
* Simple embedding syntax
